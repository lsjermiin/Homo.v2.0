PURPOSE     Homo conducts the matched-pairs test of symmetry for pairs of sequences of
            nucleotides, di-nucleotides, codons, genotypes and amino acids.
            
            Homo also computes three types of compositional distances between these pairs
            of sequences (including a compositional distance and the Euclidean distance)
 
FORMAT      Sequences must be stored in the FASTA format.
 
DATA TYPES  Sequences can be read as strings of singles, pairs or triplets of nucleotides, 
            as strings of 10- or 14-state genotypes, or as strings of amino acids.

COMPILE     g++ homo_2.0.cpp -o homo -O3 -Wall -lm

HELP        Simply type homo in the command line

STATUS      Software complete
