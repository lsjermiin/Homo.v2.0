PURPOSE     Homo conducts the matched-pairs test of symmetry for pairs of sequences of
            nucleotides, di-nucleotides, codons, genotypes and amino acids.
            
            Homo also computes three types of compositional distances between these pairs
            of sequences (including a compositional distance and the Euclidean distance)
 
FORMAT      Sequences must be stored in the FASTA format.
 
DATA TYPES  Sequences can be read a strings of one, two, or three nucleotides, strings 
            of 10- or 14-state genotypes, or as strings of amino acids.

COMPILE     g++ homo_2.0.cpp -o homo -O3 -Wall -lm

HELP        Simply type homo in the command line
